My writing journey started in the early 1990s with paper diaries to record my random thoughts and as a travel diary. Paper notebooks are great, and I still use them today as the primary place to gather thoughts. The only disadvantage of paper notebooks is finding old information and linking bits and pieces together takes a lot of work. Besides my notebooks, I also amassed a paper archive, a library and a collection of photographs. Being a computing enthusiast, I have ever since searched for the ultimate digital tool to combine all these pieces of information into the ultimate personal knowledge management system.

Over the years, I have tried a multitude of computer applications to achieve this ideal state. I wanted something that stores information in an enduring format that does not rely on a brand of software. Ideally, it had to be searchable and a single application to undertake different tasks. I used to hop from application to application, jump from the action list to my schedule, and move on to the word processor, spreadsheet, PDF reader, etc. I managed a complex web of software tools to deliver a single project. Wouldn't it be nice if there was one program that could help you with all your tasks?

My online research always pointed towards Emacs. I tried to use it in the early 2000s but quickly gave up due to the steep learning curve. About eight years ago, I tried again, and this time, I was helped by a steady flow of websites and instructional videos to get me started. Over the following years, I studied Emacs and configured it to write and publish articles and books. As I further explored the capabilities of Emacs, I discovered not only a powerful writing tool but a vibrant community of enthusiasts and developers who continually contribute to its evolution. This sense of belonging has enriched my experience, inspiring me to push the boundaries of what I can achieve with Emacs. Emacs is to me like being in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory where almost everything is possible.

I developed {{{ews}}} (EWS) to meet my specific needs for writing this book and other projects. My commitment to crafting the EWS configuration, the website online videos and this book is driven by a desire to share the benefits of my journey with other authors. EWS is not just a tool, but a culmination of years of learning and experimentation. My aim is to write the book that I would have loved to read when I first came in contact with Emacs.

This book, which is both a guide to EWS and a product of its capabilities, has been rigorously tested and refined to ensure it meets the needs of large writing projects.  

* Acknowledgements
The development and maintenance of a complex system like Emacs is a testament to the power of community. I am deeply grateful to the countless volunteers who have contributed to its core system's code and the abundance of packages. Their collective effort is what makes Emacs a thriving ecosystem.

My motivation for writing this book came from the inspiring work of people like Protesilaos (Prot) Stavrou, David Wilson from /System Crafters/ and many others who helped me flatten the learning curve of my Emacs journey through their blogs and online videos.
 
Mastodon and Emacs users Harold Kirsch, Thomas Montfort, Ben Finney, Antonio Simón (Quijote Libre), Bob Irving and  Frédéric Vachon have reviewed early versions of the book. Their feedback has helped to make this book both easier to read and more comprehensive, which is a fine balance to achieve. Erin's in-depth questions have helped me improve the explanations in this book.

Thanks to Oliver Roman, Stefan Kangas, Fredrik Salomonsson and Tomasz Hołubowicz for correcting typos.
